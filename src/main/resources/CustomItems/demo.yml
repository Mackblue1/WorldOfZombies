#
#  This is an example of 2 different custom block definitions and their drops
#  Custom drops are not required, and blocks will work normally with just "actual-block" and "disguised-block"
#  All tags in a definition are optional except "actual-block" and "disguised-block" ("drops.enabled" is required if the rest of the "drops" is empty)
#  Inside of the parent "drops" section and for item sections inside any "drop" section, there is no restriction on the amount of child drop sections or their names
#  Each tag outside the parent "drops" section cannot appear more than once, and tags inside a child drop section cannot appear more than once in a single drop section
#

demo-block:
  #  As of version 1.1.2, functionality for this option has not been added but is planned for future versions
  item: '{id:"minecraft:stone",Count:1b}'
  block:
    #  "actual-block" and "disguised-block" here are the same as the tags on custom block items in version 1.1.1
    #  If "actual-block" is empty, the server-side will not be changed when the custom block is placed
    actual-block: oak_slab

    #  If "disguised-block" is empty, the client-side block will be the same as the server-side block
    disguised-block: birch_slab[waterlogged=true]

    #  Syncs the vanilla block states between the vanilla placed block, "actual-block", and "disguised-block"
    #  The code handling "sync-states" will not succeed when "actual-block" (or the normally placed block if "actual-block" is empty) supports a state that "disguised-block" does not.
    #  For example, an "actual-block" of a log with the "facing" tag and a "disguised-block" of a diamond block would throw an error because the diamond block cannot support the "facing" tag
